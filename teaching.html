<h3>Making my slides available</h3>

While I was applying for research grants, and writing up papers after
completing my PhD, I secured an Associate Teaching Staff position
within the music department at the University of Edinburgh. I created
a series of lectures across three modules (music neuroscience, music
psychology and research methods) which were part of the "Music in the
community" MSc (academic year 2011-2012). A number of people have
expressed an interest in these lectures, so I decided to share the
slides here. Enjoy.
