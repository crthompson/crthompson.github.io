<h2>The Featherstone Set</h2>

<h3>Music, language, incongruities and aesthetics</h3>

<p> Research into similarities between music and language processing
  is an area of psychological enquiry currently experiencing a strong
  renewed interest. These pages present the stimulus set I developed
  in response to a call for more systematicity by leading researchers
  in music and language psychology.
  </p>

<p> In this auditory set, the same manipulation of congruence,
  illustrated below, was applied to the four different components at
  the centre of this field of research: harmony, rhythm, semantics and
  syntax. A paper describing the creation, norming and validation of
  this stimulus set is currently under review. Upon publication, these
  stimuli will be made available to other researchers.
  </p>

<p> The systematic approach adopted throughout this process makes this
  set a theoretically grounded and empirically validated contribution
  to this growing area of research in want of greater systematicity.

  These stimuli were developed during my PhD at the University of
  Leeds. This PhD was funded by an ESRC +3 Open Competition
  Scholarship, and was supervised by Mitch Waterman and Catriona
  Morrison.
