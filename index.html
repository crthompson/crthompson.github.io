  <strong>Welcome to my website</strong>.  Its
  contents provide details about my current work
  and my previous research, including the
  stimulus set I developed to study music and
  language processing. Hopefully you will find
  what you are looking for, but, if not, please
  don't hesitate to get in touch (details in the
  side bar to your right). <br> Happy perusal!
