<h2>What do I do?</h2>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p> Psychometrics is about psychological measurement. My work centres
  on analysing data from assessments to establish how reliable the
  assessment is, whether any items should be removed because they seem
  to be unfairly disadvantaging candidates and how the assessment as a
  whole could be improved. I also carry out analyses in which the aim
  is to see how a newly developed marking scheme compares to a
  previously used marking scheme. The results of these analyses are
  reported to lead examiners and exam boards along with advice on how
  to interpret and act on the outcomes of the analyses.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Working with the Educationalist at the Royal College of Surgeons of
  Edinburgh (RSCEd), I also provide training for our examiners. This
  training covers a number of different areas relevant to assessment,
  from examiner behaviour in practical exams to marking, writing
  questions, standard setting, and designing robust assessment
  systems. We also provide question writing and editing workshops. All
  our training days and workshops are tailored to the specific needs
  of each exam, identified through a synthesis of assessor reports,
  analyses of previous exam diets, and our scrutiny of the different
  components of each exam in the light of current best practice.</p>

<h3>Advice</h3>

<p>I also work with the Educationalist to provide advice on different
  issues relating to assessments, from candidates around the pass mark
  to marking schemes and exam structures. Combining our experience,
  knowledge and skills, our work consists in using sound design
  principles and robust analyses to ensure assessments are fit for
  purpose. </p>
