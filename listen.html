<h2>The Featherstone Set</h2>

<p>
  In this set of auditory stimuli, both congruence and resolution were
  manipulated in equivalent ways across harmony, rhythm, semantics and
  syntax. Three conditions were created by changing the context
  preceding and following musical and linguistic incongruities
  originally used for effect by authors and composers:
  <ul>
    <li>
      stimuli in the <strong>Incongruous-Resolved</strong> condition
      reproduced the original incongruity and resolution into the same
      context
      </li>
    <li>
      stimuli in the <strong>Incongruous-Unresolved</strong> condition
      reproduced the incongruity but continued post-incongruity with a
      new context dictated by the incongruity
      </li>
    <li>
      stimuli in the <strong>Congruous</strong> condition presented
      the same element of interest, but the entire context was adapted
      to match it so that it was no longer incongruous.
      </li>
    </ul>
  The manipulations rendered unrecognisable the original incongruities
  from which the stimuli were adapted, while maintaining ecological
  validity.

<h3>Harmony</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><div class="ui360"
  style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_music/h_ir.mp3">Incongruous-Resolved</a></div></dt>

  <dd>The piece starts and ends in the same key (here, F Major) but
    contains an incongruous chord, borrowed from a different key
    (here, B flat Major).</dd>

  <dt><div class="ui360"
  style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_music/h_n.mp3">Congruous</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The entire piece is in the key of the chord of interest (here, B
    flat Major), making the chord of interest congruous with its
    harmonic context.</dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_music/h_iu.mp3">Incongruous-Unresolved</a></div></dt>
  <dd>the piece starts in one key (here, F Major) and ends in the key
    of the chord of interest (here, B flat Major), precluding harmonic
    resolution. after the element of interest</dd>
  </dl>

<h3>Rhythm</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_music/r_ir.mp3">Incongruous-Resolved</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The incongruous rhythm of interest resolves into the rhythmic
    pattern of the beginning of the stimulus (here, a sequence in 4/4
    contains a bar in which the beat emphasis sounds like 9/8 and
    returns to a standard 4/4 pattern).
    </dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_music/r_n.mp3">Congruous</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The beat is adapted to fit with the rhythmic pattern of
    interest, which is no longer incongruous with its rhythmic context
    (here, the entire piece is in 9/8).</dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_music/r_iu.mp3">Incongruous-Unresolved</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The stimulus starts with one rhythmic pattern but ends with a
    different rhythmic pattern, dictated by the incongruous pattern of
    interest (here, a sequence in 4/4 continues in 9/8 after the
    rhythmic pattern of interest), precluding the resolution of the
    rhythmic incongruity into a rhythmically consistent pattern.
    </dd>

<h3>Semantics</h3>

    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_language/se_ir.mp3">Incongruous-resolved</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The sentence contains a metaphorically incongruous element
    (here, eating) that is given greater meaning in the latter part of
    the sentence</dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_language/se_n.mp3">Congruous</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The sentence contains the same element of interest (here,
    eating), but its use is literal.</dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_language/se_iu.mp3">Incongruous-unresolved</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The sentence is made up of the beginning of
     the <i>Incongruous-Resolved</i> sentence and the end of
     the <i>Congruous</i> sentence rendering it nonsensical, thereby
     precluding the semantic resolution of the incongruity.</dd>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

  <dd>the sentence presents a meaningful functional shift (noun used
    as a verb, here, trousers) which constitutes a syntactic
    incongruity which can be integrated into the sentence as a
    whole</dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_language/sy_n.mp3">Congruous</a></div></dt>
  <dd>A sentence with a simple syntactic structure uses the word of
    interest (here, trousers) as a noun.</dd>

  <dt>
    <div class="ui360"
    style="margin-top:-0.55em"><a href="/stimuli/sample_language/sy_iu.mp3">Incongruous-Unresolved</a></div></dt>
  <dd>The sentence starts as in the <i>Incongruous-Resolved</i>
    condition but then continues in with a syntactic structure
    dictated by the functional shift, precluding the syntactic
    resolution of the word of interest (here, trousers).</dd>
  </dl>
