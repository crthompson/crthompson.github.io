<h2>How did I end up doing that?</h2>

<h3>My previous work: Researching how the brain processes patterns in
  music and language</h3>

<p> A degree in psychology always involves a certain amount of
  statistics. Psychologists learn to make inferences about populations
  based on a sample of participants, by looking for patterns in the
  data which seem to be due more to an experimental manipulation than
  to chance. This involves mastering a number of different ways of
  analysing data, in line with different types of research design, and
  learnig to interpret these data. <br>

  <br> During my time at university, I enjoyed applying these research
  techniques to the study of how the brain processes music and
  language. I carried out research into cross-linguistic comparisons
  and hidden semantic meanings for my BSc dissertation, and studied
  eye movements and predictions in sentence comprehension for my MSc
  dissertation. In my PhD, I focused on the detection and processing
  of incongruities in music and language, the effects of musical
  training on language processing, and the role of incongruities in
  aesthetics. <br>

  <br> These research projects all required me to design and implement
  a reliable way of measuring the outcomes I was interested in,
  keeping up to date with published research and applying research
  methods according to best current practice. Throughout this time, I
  also learnt to communicate current developments in the field as well
  as my research findings to experts and non-experts through
  presentations and publications, and to explain statistics and
  research methods to a non-initiated audience through teaching at
  undergraduate and postgraduate level. <br>

  <br> The main activities in this line of work can be summarised as
  follows: keeping up with the research, identifying gaps in the
  literature, designing and implementing research projects to tackle
  specific issues, analysing the results, communicating the outcomes
  clearly and teaching others to equip them with the knowledge and
  skills necessary to carry out good quality research.<br> </p>


<h3>My current work: looking for patterns in data</h3>

<p>My work as a Psychometrician at RCSEd is about looking for patterns
  in exam data, interpreting these patterns and explaining them in
  meaningful ways to people who don't necessarily have a strong
  affinity for statistics so that they can act on the outcomes, having
  understood the implications of the analyses I have performed. I am
  also involved in training surgeons to apply principles of assessment
  design and implementation, to ensure that the methods used to
  measure candidates' knowledge and abilities are reliable, valid, and
  educationally sound. <br>

  <br> The main activities are in fact very similar to those listed in
  my previous line of work: keeping up with research in the fields of
  education and psychometrics, identifying potential problems in
  assessments, designing and helping with the implementation of ways
  to tackle the issues identified, analysing exam datax, communicating
  the outcomes clearly and training examiners to equip them with the
  knowledge and skills necessary to produce good quality
  assessments. <br> </p>
