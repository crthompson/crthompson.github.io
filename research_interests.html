<h2>Research interests and co-authors</h2>

<h3>Language psychology</h3>

<p>Having grown up in a bilingual family, I've always been interested
  in how the brain does language. I've always been fascinated by how
  making sounds or squiggling shapes enables me to get a thought from
  inside my brain into the brains of others. Weird, eh? Growing up
  with two languages also raised my awareness of the sometimes
  arbitrary relationship between sounds (or squiggles) and meaning,
  and of the discrepancies between languages in terms of vocabulary
  (try translating shimmer, shine and glisten into French),
  expressions ("c'est le geste qui compte") and hidden meanings
  (ladybirds have nothing to do with ladies or birds; bats in French
  are "bald mice"). <br>

  <br>My psychology undergraduate dissertation, supervised by Dr Zazie
  Todd, explored hidden meanings in French and English, to see whether
  there were discrepancies across speakers of different languages in
  the meanings evoked by certain words because of the words which make
  up these words (e.g. ladybird). The data were pretty inconclusive,
  but that's ok, it was a fun project. <br>

  <br>For my MSc, armed with a better grasp of experimental design,
  and some more fancy equipment, I studied eye movements in sentence
  processing, to see what kind of information we predict during
  sentence process (the general gist, or the next pronoun to be used).
  Yes, I studied pronoun processing, but it was all about how we make
  use of probabilities to facilitate speedy processing of sentences.
  For instance, in the sentence "Mary praised John because..." you
  would expect "he did something amazing". Previous research had
  repeatedly shown difficulties in processing the continuation "she
  thought he was great" and authors had suggested that this was
  because readers anticipate the pronoun "he" after "because".
  However, they didn't test sentences such as "Mary praised John
  because there had been some great reviews of his latest show". So
  that's what I set out to do, supervised
  by <a href="http://www.psy.ed.ac.uk/people/psturt/"

  published <a href="/Featherstone&Sturt2010_QJEP.pdf"

<h3>Music psychology</h3>

<p>The bilingual family I grew up in was
  (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8La-g95mo5Y"
  title="hannahclair">and still is</a>) also very musical. This led to
  a second fascination of how a combination of sounds can sound nice,
  or not so nice, in time or not, surprising, disturbing, and, as we
  like to put it "crunchy". Two main questions were fuelled by the
  things I was studying in my joint honours degree: How can music
  express emotions? and Does being able to express emotions through
  music, where language can be limited, help people process their
  emotions better? <br>

  <br>The first question I left until my PhD, apart from a few
  undergraduate essays in which I discovered what is
  possibly <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Emotion_and_Meaning_in_Music.html?id=HuWCVGKhwy0C"
  title="meyer1956">my favorite book on music and emotions</a>. The
  second, I decided to tackle in a second undergraduate dissertation,
  supervised by <a href="http://music.leeds.ac.uk/people/luke-windso/"
  title="lukewindsor">Dr Luke Windsor</a>, by administring emotional
  intelligence questionnaires to musicians and non-musicians. Once
  again, the results were inconclusive, but it was a fun project, and
  the systematic review of the literature in the field put me in a
  good position to start thinking about how violations of predictions
  in music (and also in language) can lead to aesthetic experiences
  and emotions.

  <h3>Music, language, the brain, aesthetics, emotions... If you're
    going to spend three years on it, you might as well pick something
    fun</h3>

<p><br> In my PhD, I focused on the detection and processing of
  incongruities in music and language, the effects of musical training
  on language processing, and the role of incongruities in aesthetics.
  "Um, ok?" I hear you say. I was interested in the fact that music
  and language both seem to have the capacity for generating emotions
  by going against our expectations (think the key change in "All by
  myself" - yep, you know the one), and think of lyrics like "here I
  stand, six feet small" (John Mayer, 83). These both make us go "ooh"
  (or something along those lines) because they go against what we
  expect. The interesting thing is, researchers have also demonstrated
  similar patterns in the brain in response to unexpected chords or
  rhythms and words which are unexpected because of their meaning or
  because of the grammar of the sentence. <br>

  <br>I pretty much packed all my main psychology interests into three
  years of research, making it a fascinating time, albeit with a few
  ups and downs. I had the privilege of being supervised
  by <a href="http://www.psyc.leeds.ac.uk/cgi-bin/10/people/index.pl?mitchw"
  title="lukewindsor">Dr Mitch Waterman</a> and
  <a href="http://www.psyc.leeds.ac.uk/cgi-bin/10/people/index.pl?catriona"
     title="catrionamorrison">Dr Catriona Morrison</a> , and of
     benefiting from some much needed ERP guidance
     from <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/lucy.macgregor/"
     title="lucymacgregor">Dr Lucy MacGregor</a>. I'm afraid we're
     still working on a few papers from this research, so I can't tell
     you too much about it (I'll add links to the papers once they're
     "out there"). This time we got some exciting results
  <strong>and</strong> it was a fun
  project. Win! </p>
